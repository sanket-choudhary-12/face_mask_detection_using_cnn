Face Mask Detection using CNN

Overview

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based application designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in a given photo. With the growing need for public health safety measures, this tool helps in automating the process of mask detection.

Features

Accurate Detection: The model is trained to accurately identify the presence of face masks in images.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and easy-to-use script for detection.
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing images in real-time for quick results.

Installation

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to Project Directory: Open the project directory.
Install Dependencies: Ensure all required dependencies are installed by referring to the requirements file.

Usage

Prepare Your Image: Ensure the image you want to analyze is ready.
Run the Detection Script: Execute the detection script on your image.
View Results: The script will output whether a mask is detected or not.

Results

The model provides reliable and quick detection results. Below is an example of the output produced by the model:


Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, including both images with and without masks. The dataset is balanced and preprocessed to ensure high accuracy.

Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to effectively learn and generalize the features required for mask detection.

Performance
Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset.
Precision and Recall: Balanced precision and recall metrics indicate the model's robustness.
